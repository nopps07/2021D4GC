# 2021D4GC

The purpose of this document is to summarize the journey to the 2021 Data 4 Good Challenge and provide self-feedback to ourselves that would be useful for next D4GC challenges.

My name is Gunho Lee, who took the position of Lead D4GC challenge, and I would like to send massive thanks to the entire Emergent team, especially to the Executive Board, Rishi and Juli who had been hard working together.

The document will consist of mainly three parts:
- Strategical data brain-storming
- Technical data build-up
- Summarzing data
